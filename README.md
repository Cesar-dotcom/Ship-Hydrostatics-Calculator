# shipHydrostaticsCalculator

This repo will contain a numerical tool to calculate ship hydrostatics. The project aims to deeply understand how ship hydrostatics works by developing a tool from scratch.

- Procedure
1. Import gdf (Geometric data file).
2. Set waterline, cog, trim and heel.
3. Calculate hydrostatics.
4. Hydrostatics Output Analysis.

*DISCLAIMER: this is not a validation tool and commercial software should be used instead. I Might include test cases to calculate the accuracy of the model.
